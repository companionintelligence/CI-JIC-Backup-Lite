Signs and Symptoms of Fractures\n\nIndications of a fracture are deformity, tenderness, swelling, pain, inability\nto move the injured part, protruding bone, bleeding, or discolored skin at the\ninjury site.  A sharp pain when the service member attempts to move the part\nis also a sign of a fracture.\n\nWARNING"}
{"filename": "Full-First-Aid-Manual.pdf", "text": "WARNING\n\nDO NOT encourage the casualty to move the injured\npart in order to identify a fracture since such movement\ncould cause further damage to surrounding tissues and\npromote shock.  If you are not sure whether a bone is\nfractured, care for the injury as a fracture.  At the site of\nthe fracture, the bone ends are sharp and could cause\nvessel (artery and/or vein) damage.\n\n4-4. Purposes of Immobilizing Fractures"}
{"filename": "Full-First-Aid-Manual.pdf", "text": "4-4. Purposes of Immobilizing Fractures\n\nA fracture is immobilized to prevent the sharp edges of the bone from\nmoving and cutting tissue, muscle, blood vessels, and nerves.  This reduces\npain and helps prevent or control shock.  In a closed fracture, immobilization\nkeeps bone fragments from causing an open wound, which can become\ncontaminated and subject to infection.\n\n4-5.

When faced with the necessity of rescuing a casualty who is\nthreatened by hostile action, fire, water, or any other immediate hazard, DO\nNOT take action without first determining the extent of the hazard and your\nability to handle the situation.  DO NOT become a casualty.\n\nb. The rescuer must evaluate the situation and analyze the factors\ninvolved.  This evaluation involves three major steps:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Identify the task."}

Considerations\n\na. First determine if a rescue attempt is actually needed.  It is a\nwaste of time, equipment, and personnel to rescue someone not in need of\nrescuing.  It is also a waste to look for someone who is not lost or needlessly\nrisk the lives of the rescuer(s).
