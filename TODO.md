# Areas of improvement

- scripts to fetch torrents of collections such as project gutenburg

- evaluate other strategies for indexing beyond faiss

- live geographically local data would be good to aggregate on a live basis - maybe beyond scope here

- enumerate hardware choices, battery backups, emp proofing, blu-ray backups
